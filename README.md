# SamuraiApp-Core30
This is a project created by Julie Lerman for Pluralsight used in her course Entity Framwork Core 2: Getting Started. Except I created it using Visual Studio 2019 and .NET Core 3.1

# Status
Currently working through Julie's course, about 80% through. Her course targets .NET Core 2x 
but as I add new code and encounter breaking changes or areas where I know 3.1 has enhancements I will modify the code accordingly.

My hope is that other developers can use this as a reference for .NET Core 3.1 projects whenever they get stuck or their training doesn't cover a specific topic.
