# About SamuraiApp-Core30
This is a project created by Julie Lerman for Pluralsight used in her course Entity Framwork Core 2: Getting Started. Except I created it using Visual Studio 2019 and .NET Core 3.1. UPDATE: Julie Lerman has released a 3.1 version of this course and I am now using code examples from that course in addition to what I've already added from her previous course.

# About the console app
The console app has a long list of methods that are just used for testing different scenarios. These methods come directly from Julie's courses except that on a few of them I've renamed the method or added comments to explain and give context to some of the code. I will be using this project as my go-to app for referencing EFCore code moving forward so I will be modifying these methods to help me achieve that goal.

# Status
Currently working through Julie's new Pluralsight course which targets EF Core 3.1, so I will be adding and modifying the code to reflect the new version.

My hope is that other developers can use this as a reference for .NET Core 3.1 projects whenever they get stuck or their training doesn't cover a specific topic.
